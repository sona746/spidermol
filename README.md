Project Description : HairCount™ is a satirical web app that pretends to count the hairs on your hand using “AI.” It produces random numbers, fake stats, and sarcastic quotes — solving a problem nobody ever had.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
What if you really wanted to know how many hairs are on your hand?
Exactly. You don't. But now you can.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a completely unnecessary yet beautifully overengineered AI-powered scanner that takes a hand photo, fakes analysis, and delivers hair counts that are 100% inaccurate and 200% confident.
